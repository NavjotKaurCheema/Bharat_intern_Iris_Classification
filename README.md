ðŸŒºðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Project ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ·


## Overview
The Iris Flower Classification Project is a web-based application designed to predict the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. This project utilizes a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, or Iris-virginica.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for inputting sepal and petal measurements.
- Interactive arrow buttons for convenient adjustment of parameter values.
- Predicted flower class displayed along with an associated image of the iris species.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: Web framework for Python used to create the web application.
- HTML and CSS: Front-end development for the user interface.
- Python: Programming language used to build the machine learning model.
- Machine Learning Model: Trained model for iris flower classification.
